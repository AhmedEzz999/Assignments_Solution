// Q15: What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it impact the way variables are used?
void main() {
  /*
  A statically-typed language is a programming language in which variable types are determined at compile time
  rather than at runtime. This means that once a variable is assigned a type, it cannot change,
  and any type mismatches will be caught by the compiler before the program runs.
  Dart is optionally statically typed, meaning it supports both static and dynamic typing. By default,
  Dart is statically typed, but you can also write dynamically-typed code if needed.
