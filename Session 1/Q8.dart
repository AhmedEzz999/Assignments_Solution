// Q8: What is the difference between the num and double data types in Dart?
void main() {
  /* num can hold integer and floating-point numbers
  (numbers with decimal points and without)
  double can hold floating-point numbers and
  converting integer numbers to a floating-point number
  double converts '10' to '10.0'
  num is more flexible than double in dealing with mathematics operations
