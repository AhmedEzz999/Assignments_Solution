// Q10: Implement an employee payroll system.
// Create a base Employee class with properties: name, id, and salary.
// Implement a method calculateSalary() in the base class.
// Create two subclasses:
// FullTimeEmployee: Adds a bonus and overrides calculateSalary() to include the bonus.
// PartTimeEmployee: Adds hoursWorked and hourlyRate, overriding calculateSalary() to compute salary based on hours worked.
void main() {
  // I'll solve them very soon.
